However, the Court clarified that even if someone meets the conditions of Article 5, they could still be denied citizenship if they migrated to Pakistan after March 1, 1947, as outlined in Article 7.

<p>	In the State of Bihar v. Kumar Amar Singh (1955) case, a woman known as Kumar Rani traveled to Pakistan in July 1948 for what she claimed was medical treatment. She argued that since her husband remained in India, she should still be considered an Indian citizen under Article 5 of the Constitution, which grants citizenship based on domicile and birth in India.
	However, the Supreme Court found her claims unconvincing, noting that she had actually migrated to Pakistan after March 1, 1947. Article 7 states that anyone who migrated to Pakistan after this date cannot claim Indian citizenship. The Court concluded that even if her husband's domicile was India, it did not grant her citizenship because Article 7 overrides Article 5 in such cases. Thus, her migration disqualified her from being recognized as an Indian citizen.

                <p><br>The Sarbananda Sonowal v. Union of India (2005) case is significant in the context of citizenship and immigration laws in India, particularly concerning Assam. Here’s a simplified explanation</br>
                <br><u>background </u></br>
                <br>The case arose from concerns about illegal immigration in Assam, especially from Bangladesh.
The Assam Accord was signed in 1985 to address these issues, which included provisions for granting citizenship to certain migrants.</br>
<br><u>key Issues</u></br>
<br>Section 6A of the Citizenship Act: This section allows individuals who entered Assam before January 1, 1966, to be considered citizens. Those who entered between January 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971, can also gain citizenship but cannot vote for ten years.
Petitioners argued that this provision was discriminatory and violated Article 6 of the Constitution, which sets July 19, 1948, as the cut-off date for citizenship.</br>
<br><u>Supreme Court's Role</u></br>
<br>The Supreme Court had to decide whether Section 6A was constitutional and if it unfairly impacted the rights of Assamese citizens by allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens.
The court framed several questions regarding the implications of this provision on Assamese culture and political rights</br>
<br><u>outcome</u></br>
<br>The case has been significant in shaping discussions around citizenship laws in India, particularly in Assam, and is part of ongoing debates about immigration and national identity</br>
<br><u>focus</u></br>
<br>This case challenged the constitutionality of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983 (IMDT Act)

                <br>The Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi (1981) case is significant in understanding the relationship between private educational institutions and the government in India.

<br>
<br><u>background</u></br>
<p> Ajay Hasia was the principal of a private school, and Khalid Mujib Sehravardi was a student who was denied admission.The case arose when the student challenged the school's decision, claiming it violated his rights.</p>
<br><u>Key Issue</u></br>
<p>The main question was whether private schools, even though they are not government-run, could be considered "State" under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution.This determination would mean that private schools must also respect fundamental rights, like the right to education.</p>
<br><u>supreme court decision </u></br>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that private educational institutions receiving substantial government aid could be classified as "other authorities" under Article 12.This means they are accountable for upholding fundamental rights and can be challenged in court if they violate these rights.</p>
<br><u>Implication</u></br> 
<p>The ruling established that private schools must operate fairly and cannot discriminate against students.It reinforced the idea that even non-governmental entities performing public functions are subject to judicial review and must respect citizens' rights.</p>
<p>In simple terms, this case ensured that private schools in India are held to the same standards as public institutions when it comes to protecting students' rights</p>
<p><br><u><span style="color:red;">Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (2002)</span></u></br></p>
<br> In Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (2002), the Supreme Court examined whether the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) qualifies as a "State" under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution. The case arose when employees challenged their termination by CSIR. Previously, in Sabhajit Tewary's case, CSIR was deemed not a "State," but this ruling was contested.

</br>
<br>The Supreme Court found that CSIR is significantly controlled and funded by the government, thus classifying it as a "State." This landmark decision overruled the earlier judgment and clarified that entities with substantial government involvement can be considered "State" under Article 12, ensuring employees' rights to seek legal remedies against such bodies.

                <br>In Keshavan Madhava Menon v. State of Bombay (1951), the Supreme Court addressed whether laws that violate fundamental rights are considered void from the beginning (ab initio) or only ineffective going forward. The case involved a challenge to the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act.</br>

<br>The Court ruled that laws inconsistent with fundamental rights do not become void from the start but are ineffective prospectively. This means that if someone committed an offense under such a law before it was declared void, they could still be prosecuted. Essentially, the ruling clarified that while laws can be declared void due to inconsistency with fundamental rights, they remain applicable to past actions until that declaration is made.

</span></u></br></p>
<br>In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court decided that Parliament can change the Constitution but cannot alter its "basic structure," which includes key features like democracy and fundamental rights. The case arose when Kesavananda Bharati challenged a law that took over land from his monastery. This ruling established the basic structure doctrine, protecting essential parts of the Constitution from being changed by Parliament.</br>
<mark style="color:green;"><u><br><strong>2 Important Aspect</strong></br></u></mark>
<strong><head><ul><li><u>Doctrine of Eclipse </u>
 </li></ul></head></strong>
 <br>The Doctrine of Eclipse is a legal principle in India that deals with laws that conflict with fundamental rights. Here’s a simple breakdown:</br>
 <br> <strong style="color: purple;" >What it means : </strong></br>
 <br>If a law is made that goes against the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, that law doesn’t become completely void or dead. Instead, it becomes "eclipsed," like how the sun is hidden during a solar eclipse.</br>
 <br><strong style="color:purple;">Temporary Effect :</strong></br>
 <br>While the law is eclipsed, it cannot be enforced. However, it can come back into effect if the conflict with fundamental rights is resolved.</br>
 <br><strong style="color:purple;">Pre constitutional Law</strong></br>
 <br>This doctrine mainly applies to laws that were made before the Constitution came into effect in 1950. These laws can be revived if they are amended to align with fundamental rights.</br>
 <br><strong style ="color:purple;"> Judicial Role</strong></br>
 <br>The courts play an important role in deciding whether a law is eclipsed and whether it can be revived.</br>
<br> <strong><head><ul><li><u>Doctrine of Severability</u></li></ul></head></strong></br>
<br> The Doctrine of Severability is a legal principle that allows courts to separate unconstitutional provisions of a law from its valid parts. Here’s a concise overview:</br>
<br><strong style="color:purple;">Separation of Provisions</strong></br>
<br> If a specific provision of a statute is found to violate the Constitution, only that provision is declared void, while the rest of the statute remains effective.</br>
<br><strong style="color:purple;">Application</strong></br>
 <br>This doctrine applies when valid and invalid parts can be clearly distinguished. If they are interlinked and cannot be separated, the entire statute may be struck down.</br>
 <br><strong style ="color:purple;">Constitutional Basis</strong></br>
 <br>Article 13 of the Indian Constitution supports this doctrine by stating that laws inconsistent with fundamental rights are void only to the extent of their inconsistency.</br>
 <br><strong style ="color:purple;">Judicial Interpretation</strong></br>
 <br>Courts determine whether the invalid portion can be severed without altering the law's overall intent or functionality</br>

<p><br><u><strong style ="color:#ff00ff;">Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar (1958)</strong></u></br></p>
<br>In the case of Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar (1958), the Supreme Court focused on the principle of equality under Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court introduced the "classification test," which allows the government to treat different groups differently, as long as this classification is based on clear differences and serves a valid purpose.</br>
<br>The Court struck down a law because it gave the government too much power to classify offenses without clear guidelines, leading to arbitrary treatment. This case laid the groundwork for understanding how equality and reasonable classification work in Indian law.

<br>In Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975), the Supreme Court examined the validity of the 39th Amendment, which aimed to protect Indira Gandhi's election from being challenged in court. Raj Narain contested her election, claiming electoral misconduct.</br>
<br>The Court ruled that the amendment violated Article 14, which guarantees equality before the law. It stated that no one, including the Prime Minister, should be above the law. The ruling emphasized that laws must apply equally to everyone and cannot provide special privileges to any individual. This case reinforced the principle of accountability in governance and upheld the right to equality.

Joshi argued that this reservation violated Article 15(1), which prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, or place of birth.</br>
<br>The Court upheld the reservation, stating that Article 15(1) does not prevent the state from making special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes. The ruling emphasized that such provisions are valid if they aim to improve educational opportunities for these groups, thereby promoting equality in society.
</br>

<br>In State of Madras v.

She argued that this policy violated her right to equality under Articles 15(1) and 29(2) of the Constitution. 
</br>
<br>The Court ruled that the reservation policy was unconstitutional because it discriminated against her based on caste.

<p>The Court upheld the idea of reservations but set a limit, stating that the total reservation should not exceed 50%. This ruling aimed to balance the need for affirmative action with the principle of equality, ensuring that reservations do not unfairly disadvantage other groups.</p>

The case involved workers from the Scheduled Castes who were denied basic rights and faced discrimination.</p><p>The Court ruled that the state has a duty to protect individuals from violations of their rights, even when these violations are committed by private individuals. It emphasized that untouchability is not just a historical issue but continues to affect people today. This ruling reinforced the government's responsibility to ensure equality and prevent discrimination based on caste, aligning with Article 17 of the Constitution, which abolishes untouchability.</p>

<p>The Court ruled that such discrimination is a form of modern-day slavery and an extension of the caste system, which is prohibited under Article 17 of the Constitution. It emphasized that untouchability practices must be eradicated and that the state has a responsibility to protect individuals from caste-based discrimination.

<p>Challenge to Awards: The petitioners argued that these awards should be banned because they fall under the definition of titles prohibited by Article 18.
</p>
<strong style="color:green;">supreme court's decision</strong>
<p>The Court ruled that national awards do not violate Article 18. It stated that recognizing individuals for their exceptional service does not create social hierarchies, which Article 18 aims to prevent.</p>
<strong style="color:green;">Encouraging Excellence</strong>
<p>The Court emphasized that the principle of equality does not mean denying recognition to those who have contributed significantly to society.</p>
<strong style="color:green;">Recommendation</strong>
<p>It suggested forming a commission to ensure that only deserving individuals receive these awards, preventing misuse.</p>
<p>This case clarified that while Article 18 aims to abolish titles, it does not restrict acknowledging outstanding contributions to the nation.

  <p><br><u><strong style="color:red;">Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India (2017)</strong></u></br></p>
  <p>The case of Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India (2017) is significant because it deals with the designation of Senior Advocates in the legal profession and whether this practice goes against the Constitution.</p>
  <strong style="color:green;">What was the Issue ?</strong>
  <p>In India, some lawyers are given the title of Senior Advocate based on their experience and contributions to the legal field. Jaising challenged this practice, arguing that it could create inequalities among lawyers and violate Article 18 of the Constitution, which prohibits titles that create social hierarchies.</p>
  <strong style="color:green;">Main ArgumentsTitle vs. Recognition:</strong>
<p>Jaising argued that calling someone a Senior Advocate is like giving them a title, which could lead to a sense of superiority over other lawyers. She believed this could undermine the principle of equality.</p>
<strong style="color:green;">Lack of Transparency:</strong>
<p>She pointed out that the process for becoming a Senior Advocate was not clear or fair. This could lead to favoritism and unfair practices, where only certain lawyers get recognized while others do not.</p>
<strong style="color:green;">Impact on Public Interest Litigation (PIL):</strong>
<p>Jaising emphasized that if Senior Advocates are seen as more important, it might discourage others from participating in important legal cases that affect the public.</p>
<strong style="color:green;">Supreme Court Decision</strong>
<strong style="color:green;">Recognition of Merit</strong>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that the designation of Senior Advocates is not a title in the traditional sense but rather a recognition of a lawyer's skill, experience, and contributions to law.</p>
<strong style="color:green;">Not against Article 18 </strong>
<p>The Court stated that this designation does not violate Article 18 because it does not create a social hierarchy or inequality among lawyers.</p>

<p>In the Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala case (1986), three students were expelled for not singing the national anthem due to their religious beliefs as Jehovah's Witnesses. The Supreme Court ruled that expelling them violated their rights to freedom of expression and religion. The Court emphasized that individuals should not be forced to act against their beliefs unless it poses a public threat. The students were reinstated, highlighting the importance of protecting religious freedom in India.</p>
<p><br><u><span style="color:red;">Bennett Coleman & Co. v. Union of India</span></u></br></p>
<p>In the Bennett Coleman & Co. v. Union of India case (1972), the Supreme Court examined a government policy that restricted the import of newsprint, which affected how much newspapers could print. Bennett Coleman, a major newspaper publisher, argued that these restrictions violated their right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p>The Court agreed, stating that the restrictions were unconstitutional because they unjustly limited the press's ability to operate freely. This landmark ruling reinforced the idea that freedom of the press is essential for democracy and clarified that any government limitations must be reasonable and not excessive.</p>

<p><br><u><span style="color:red;">Kedarnath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962)</span></u> </br></p>
<p>In the Kedarnath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962) case, the Supreme Court of India addressed the controversial sedition law under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code</p>
<b><u><span style="color:purple;">Background</span></u></b>
<p>Kedarnath Singh, a member of the Forward Communist Party, was arrested for making speeches criticizing the Congress government. He used strong language, calling government officials derogatory names and advocating for a revolution against capitalists and landlords. He was charged with sedition and public mischief, leading to a one-year prison sentence.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Legal challenge</span></b></u>
<p>Kedarnath appealed his conviction, arguing that the sedition law violated his right to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. This article guarantees citizens the right to express their opinions freely.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Supreme court decision</span></b></u>
<p>The Supreme Court had to decide whether Section 124A was constitutional. The key points from their ruling included:Freedom of Speech vs. Sedition: The Court acknowledged that while freedom of speech is vital in a democracy, it is not absolute. It can be restricted if it poses a threat to public order or incites violence.</p>
<u><b><u><span style="color:purple;">Definition of sedition</span></u></b></u>
<p>The Court clarified that not all criticism of the government amounts to sedition. Only statements that incite violence or public disorder can be penalized under this law.</p>
<u><b><u><span style="color:purple;">Reasonable Restrictions</span></u></b></u>
<p>The Court upheld Section 124A as constitutionally valid, stating that it serves a necessary purpose in maintaining public order. However, it emphasized that criticism of government policies is acceptable as long as it does not incite hatred or violence</p>
<u><b><u><span style="color:purple;">Implications </span></u></b></u>
<p>The judgment set important precedents for interpreting sedition laws in India, balancing individual rights with state interests</p>
<u><b><u><span style="color:purple;">Conclusion</span></u></b></u>
<p>Kedarnath Singh’s case is significant because it shaped how sedition is understood in India today. It established that while citizens can criticize their government, such expressions must not threaten public peace or order. This ruling remains relevant as debates about free speech and sedition laws continue in contemporary India.</p>
<p><u><b><u><span style="color:red;">State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad</span></u></b></u></p>
<p>The case State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad (1961) is significant in Indian law, particularly concerning the rights of accused individuals under Article 20(3) of the Constitution, which protects against self-incrimination</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Background</span></b></u>
<p>Kathi Kalu Oghad and others were accused of murder. During the investigation, the police obtained handwriting samples from Oghad while he was in custody. The prosecution wanted to use these samples as evidence to prove his involvement in the crime</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Legal Issue</span></b></u>
<p>Oghad argued that taking his handwriting samples violated Article 20(3), which states that no person accused of a crime can be compelled to be a witness against themselves. 

The key question was whether providing handwriting samples constituted self-incrimination</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">High court</span></b></u>
<p>On appeal, the High Court ruled that the samples were inadmissible because they were taken while Oghad was in police custody, implying an element of compulsion.
The High Court acquitted him due to insufficient evidence without the handwriting samples.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">supreme court Ruling</span></b></u>
<p>The State of Bombay appealed to the Supreme Court, which had to decide on several crucial points</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">self incrimination</span></b></u><p>The Supreme Court ruled that providing physical evidence like fingerprints or handwriting samples does not fall under "being a witness against oneself." This means that such evidence can be obtained even if the person is in custody.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Distinction</span></b></u>
<p>The Court distinguished between verbal testimony (which could incriminate) and physical evidence (which does not involve self-testimony). Thus, taking fingerprints or handwriting samples does not violate Article 20(3).</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">outcome</span></b></u>
<p>The Supreme Court upheld the trial court's decision regarding the admissibility of physical specimens but noted that the High Court's acquittal was based on insufficient evidence without those specimens</p>
<u><b><span style ="color:purple;">Conculsion</span></b></u>
<p>The ruling in this case clarified that while individuals have rights against self-incrimination, those rights do not extend to physical evidence collection like fingerprints or handwriting samples. This case is pivotal for understanding how constitutional protections apply in criminal proceedings and has implications for law enforcement practices in India.</p>

<p><u><b><span style="color:red;">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</span></b></u></p>
<p>The Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India case (1978) is a pivotal Supreme Court ruling that expanded the interpretation of Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Background</span></b></u>
<p>Maneka Gandhi's passport was impounded by the government without explanation, citing "public interest." She challenged this action in the Supreme Court, arguing it violated her fundamental rights.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Key Issue</span></b></u>
<ol><li>Right to Travel: Is the right to travel abroad part of personal liberty under Article 21?</li>
<li>Interconnected Rights: Are Articles 14 (equality), 19 (freedom of speech and movement), and 21 interconnected?</li>
<li>Fair Procedure: Does the procedure established by law need to be fair and just?</li>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Judgement</span></b></u>
On January 25, 1978, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that:
<ul><li>The right to travel is indeed part of personal liberty.</li>
<li>Articles 14, 19, and 21 are interconnected, forming a "Golden Triangle" of rights.</li>
<li>The government must provide a fair procedure before depriving someone of their liberty.</li></ul>
<br>The Court emphasized that laws affecting personal liberty must not be arbitrary or unjust. This ruling significantly broadened the scope of Article 21, reinforcing citizens' rights against arbitrary state actions.</br>
<p><u><b><span style="color:red;">Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh case (1962)</span></b></u></p>
<p>The Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh case (1962) is significant in the context of personal liberty and privacy rights in India.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Background</span></b></u>
<p>Kharak Singh was subjected to police surveillance under Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations, which allowed the police to monitor individuals considered "habitual criminals." This included nighttime visits to his home, where police would wake him up and check on him, leading Singh to challenge these practices as violations of his rights.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Key Issue</span></b></u>
<p><ul><li>Right to Privacy: Did the surveillance violate Singh's right to privacy?</li>
<li>Freedom of Movement: Did the regulations restrict his freedom to move freely?</li></ul></p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Supreme court decision</span></b></u>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that:
<ol><li>Domiciliary Visits Unconstitutional: The practice of police visiting homes at odd hours was deemed unconstitutional as it violated the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21.</li>
<li>Surveillance Not a Violation: However, the Court upheld other surveillance measures, stating they did not infringe on Singh's rights because they were discreet and did not hinder his movement directly.</li></ol></p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Distinction opinion</span></b></u>
<p>Justice Subba Rao dissented, arguing that constant surveillance infringed on personal dignity and privacy, which should be recognized as fundamental rights. He contended that the regulations violated not just Article 21 but also Article 19, which protects freedom of expression and movement</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Impact</span></b></u>
<p>While the majority did not recognize privacy as a fundamental right at that time, this case laid the groundwork for future discussions on privacy in India, culminating in its eventual recognition as a fundamental right in later judgments.</p>

<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Unni Krishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh case (1993) </span></b></u>
<p>The Unni Krishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh case (1993) is a landmark Supreme Court decision that established the right to education as a fundamental right in India</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Background</span></b></u>
<p>Unni Krishnan and others challenged the government's policies regarding education, particularly the high fees charged by private institutions and the lack of adequate educational facilities. They argued that the state had a duty to provide free and compulsory education to all children.</p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Key Issue</span></b></u>
<p><ol><li>Fundamental Right to Education: Is education a fundamental right under Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty)?</li>
<li>State Obligations: What responsibilities does the state have in ensuring education for children?</li></ol></p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Supreme court decision</span></b></u>
<p><ul><li>The Supreme Court ruled that:
Right to Education: The right to basic education is implicit in Article 21, meaning every child has the right to free education until the age of 14.</li>
<li>State Responsibility: The state must provide free and compulsory education as outlined in Article 45 of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Regulation of Private Institutions: The Court emphasized that private educational institutions should be regulated to ensure fair access and quality education for all children</li></ul></p>
<u><b><span style="color:purple;">Impact</span></b></u>
<p>This judgment led to significant changes, including the 86th Amendment to the Constitution in 2002, which explicitly recognized the right to education as a fundamental right under Article 21A, mandating free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14. This case was crucial in shaping educational policy and reinforcing the importance of accessible education in India.</p>

<p>The S.P. Mittal v. Union of India case, decided in 1983, revolves around the Auroville (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1980, which was enacted due to mismanagement and financial irregularities in the Auroville township, founded by the Sri Aurobindo Society.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>After the death of the society's co-founder, significant issues arose regarding management and misuse of funds. The Indian government intervened, leading to the enactment of the Auroville Act to ensure proper governance and accountability.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Legal Issue</strong></b></p>
<p>The petitioners, including S.P. Mittal, challenged the Act on several grounds:</p>
<p><ul><li>They argued that the Act violated their rights under Articles 25 and 26, which protect religious freedom.</li>
<li>They claimed that Auroville constituted a religious denomination and that the government’s intervention was unlawful.</li></ul>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Supreme court ruling </strong></b></p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that:
<ul><li>Auroville and the Sri Aurobindo Society did not qualify as a religious denomination because their activities were not based on a system of beliefs that could be categorized as a religion.</li>
<li>The government had the right to regulate organizations for public interest, especially when serious irregularities were found.</li>
<li>The Act was constitutionally valid as it aimed to address management issues rather than interfere with religious practices.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>This ruling clarified the boundaries of religious freedom under Articles 25 and 26, emphasizing that while individuals have rights to manage their religious affairs, these rights can be regulated by law for public welfare. The case set a precedent for balancing individual rights with governmental authority in matters involving public interest and accountability.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:#000080;">The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Shri Lakshmindar Tirtha Swamiyar of Shri Shirur Mutt (1954)</strong></b></p>
<p>In the Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Shri Lakshmindar Tirtha Swamiyar of Shri Shirur Mutt case (1954), the Supreme Court addressed the rights of religious denominations under Article 26 of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>The case involved a dispute over the management of a Hindu religious institution, the Shirur Mutt. The government had enacted laws that affected how religious institutions were managed, which led to concerns about interference in religious practices.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points of the judgement</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Definition of Religion: The court defined religion as a system of beliefs or doctrines that are essential for spiritual well-being. It emphasized that religion is not just about beliefs but also includes practices and rituals.</li>
<li>Rights of Religious Denominations: The court ruled that every religious denomination has the right to manage its own affairs, including establishing and maintaining institutions for religious purposes. This right is protected under Article 26.</li>
<li>Limits on State Intervention: The Supreme Court stated that while the state can regulate religious practices, it cannot interfere in matters that are essential to the religion unless those practices violate public order or morality.</li>
<li>Protection of Internal Affairs: The judgment reinforced that religious groups have autonomy over their internal affairs, meaning they can decide how to conduct their rituals and manage their properties without undue interference from the government.</li></ul><p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>This case was significant because it clarified the scope of Article 26, reinforcing the rights of religious denominations to manage their affairs independently while also outlining the limits of state intervention.

<p><b><u>ARTICLE 27– FREEDOM AS TO PAYMENT OF TAXES FOR PROMOTION OF ANY PARTICULAR RELIGION </u></b></p>

<p><b><strong style="color:#000080;">Prafull Goradia v. Union of India (2002)</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>Prafull Goradia was a taxpayer who argued that some of his taxes were being used to fund the Haj pilgrimage, which is a religious journey for Muslims. He felt that this was unfair and against the Indian Constitution, specifically Article 27, which says you shouldn’t be forced to pay taxes that support a particular religion.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">The court:s Decision</strong></b></p>
<p><ul>The Supreme Court looked at Goradia's argument and decided that:
<li><u>Not Enough Evidence</u>: Goradia couldn’t show that a significant part of his taxes was actually being used for the Haj.</li>
<li><u>Secular Taxation</u>: The Court emphasized that as long as tax money isn’t mainly used to support one religion over another, it doesn’t violate Article 27.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>In the end, the Court ruled against Goradia, saying that just because some tax money might go to religious activities doesn’t mean it’s wrong unless it’s a large amount specifically for one religion. This case helped clarify how taxes can be used in a secular country like India.</p>

<p><b><strong style="color:red;#FF4433">DAV college v/s state of punjab </strong></b></p>
<p>The D.A.V. College vs. State of Punjab (1971) case is important for understanding the rights of minority educational institutions in India.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>D.A.V. College, run by the Arya Samaj, challenged certain state laws that regulated how it could operate. The college argued that these laws interfered with its right to manage its own affairs, which is protected under Article 30 of the Constitution.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Minority Rights: The Supreme Court ruled that minority institutions have the fundamental right to establish and run their own schools without excessive government interference.</li>
<li>State Regulations: While the state can set rules to ensure education standards, these rules must not disrupt the college's autonomy.</li>
<li>Judgment Impact: The ruling reinforced the protection of minority rights in education, ensuring that such institutions can maintain their unique character and cultural identity.</li></ul></p>
Overall, this case established a balance between state oversight and the rights of minority educational institutions.
<p><b><strong style="color:#804433;">The Guru Nanak University(1971)</strong></b></p>
<p>The Guru Nanak University Case (1971) involved a challenge to a law that required students at Guru Nanak University to study the teachings of Guru Nanak.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>Some colleges argued that this requirement violated Article 28 of the Indian Constitution, which protects individuals from being forced to attend religious instruction in state-funded institutions.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li><u>Supreme Court Ruling:</u> The Court decided that studying the life and teachings of Guru Nanak was not considered religious instruction. Instead, it was viewed as an academic subject.</li>
<li><u>Secular Education:</u> The Court emphasized the importance of maintaining a secular education system, allowing for the study of influential figures without promoting any specific religion.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>This case clarified that academic studies related to religious figures do not violate Article 28, as long as they are presented in a secular context.</p>

<p><b><strong style="color:#800080;">State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951)</strong></b></p>
<p>The State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951) case is a significant legal decision regarding educational rights in India.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>In this case, the Madras government issued an order that set quotas for admissions to medical and engineering colleges based on religion and caste. This meant that certain groups could only admit a limited number of students from specific communities.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Violation of Rights: Champakam Dorairajan challenged this order, arguing that it violated Article 29(2) of the Indian Constitution, which states that no citizen should be denied admission to educational institutions maintained by the state based on religion, race, caste, or language.</li>
<li>Supreme Court Ruling: The Supreme Court agreed with Dorairajan and ruled that the government's quota system was unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that admission should be based on merit rather than caste or religion.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>This ruling led to significant changes in how admissions were handled in educational institutions and prompted amendments to the Constitution to allow special provisions for backward classes while still protecting individual rights against discrimination.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:#E0115F;">Ravneet Kaur v. Christian Medical College (1997)</strong></b></p>
The Ravneet Kaur v. Christian Medical College (1997) case is significant for understanding the rights of minority educational institutions in India.
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>In this case, Ravneet Kaur, a student, challenged the admission policies of the Christian Medical College, which favored Christian students. The college argued that as a minority institution, it had the right to give preference to students from its own community.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Supreme Court Ruling: The Supreme Court ruled that even though the college was a minority institution, it could not discriminate against students based on religion when receiving government aid.</li>
<li>Article 29(2): The Court emphasized that all citizens have the right to equal access to educational institutions without discrimination based on religion, caste, or race.</li>
<li>Impact on Minority Rights: The ruling reinforced that minority institutions must follow non-discriminatory practices in admissions while still being allowed to maintain their identity.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>This case established that while minority institutions have certain rights, they cannot use those rights to exclude students from other communities, especially when they receive state support.</p>

<p>The T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) case is a landmark Supreme Court decision regarding the rights of minority educational institutions in India.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>The T.M.A. Pai Foundation was established to promote education for the Konkani-speaking community. The State of Karnataka passed a law to regulate private educational institutions, including capping fees and controlling admissions, which the Foundation challenged as unconstitutional.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Minority Rights: The Supreme Court recognized that minorities have the right to establish and manage their educational institutions under Article 30 of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Autonomy of Institutions: The Court ruled that minority institutions should have reasonable autonomy in their operations, including admission processes and fee structures.</li>
<li>Regulation by the State: While the Court acknowledged the need for some state regulation to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation (like capitation fees), it emphasized that such regulations should not interfere excessively with the institutions' rights.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>The ruling established a balance between the autonomy of minority educational institutions and the state's power to regulate them, ensuring that minorities can maintain their cultural identity while also providing quality education. This case has had a lasting impact on how private educational institutions operate in India.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:#023020;">Kerala Education Bill Case (1958)</strong></b></p>
<p>The Kerala Education Bill Case (1958) involved a challenge to the Kerala Education Bill, which aimed to regulate private educational institutions in the state.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>The Kerala government introduced this bill to improve the education system, but it included provisions that gave the government significant control over private schools, including regulations on fees and management.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key points</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Supreme Court Reference: The President of India referred questions about the bill's constitutionality to the Supreme Court. The main issues were whether the bill violated the rights of minority institutions under Article 30, which protects their ability to manage their educational institutions.</li>
<li>Court's Ruling: The Supreme Court ruled that certain provisions of the bill were unconstitutional because they imposed excessive restrictions on minority institutions. Specifically, it found that prohibiting these schools from charging tuition fees deprived them of necessary income and violated their rights.</li>
<li>Protection of Minority Rights: The Court emphasized that while the state can regulate education, it must not infringe upon the rights of minorities to establish and manage their institutions.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>This case reinforced the importance of protecting minority educational rights while allowing for reasonable state regulation, ensuring that minority institutions can operate without undue interference.</p>

<p><b><strong style="color:	#191970;">A.D.M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla</strong></b></p>
<p>The case of A.D.M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976), often referred to as the "Habeas Corpus case," was a significant Supreme Court ruling in India regarding the right to personal liberty during a national emergency.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>During the Emergency declared in India from 1975 to 1977, many individuals were detained without trial. Shivkant Shukla, along with others, filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, seeking their release from unlawful detention.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Supreme court's Decision</strong></b></p>
<p>The Supreme Court controversially ruled that during an emergency, the right to file a petition for habeas corpus (a legal action to secure someone's release from unlawful detention) was suspended. The court stated that citizens could not approach it under Article 32 for relief against detentions made by the government during this period.</P>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Impact</strong></b></p>
<p>This decision faced widespread criticism for undermining individual rights and was seen as a failure to protect fundamental freedoms. Later, this ruling was overruled in subsequent cases, reaffirming that Article 32 is a fundamental right that cannot be suspended, even during emergencies. This case highlighted the importance of judicial oversight in protecting citizens' rights against arbitrary state actions.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:#191970;">Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India</strong></b></p>
<p>The Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India case (1983) is a landmark Supreme Court decision in India that addressed the issue of bonded laborers.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>Bandhua Mukti Morcha, a non-governmental organization (NGO), wrote a letter to the Supreme Court about bonded laborers working in terrible conditions at stone quarries in Faridabad, Haryana. Many of these laborers were trapped in a system where they had to work to pay off debts, often in unsafe and unhealthy environments.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Supreme court's decision</strong></b></p>
<pp>The Supreme Court treated the letter as a formal petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, which allows individuals to seek justice for violations of their fundamental rights. The court appointed a commission to investigate the conditions at the quarries.</p>
<p>The investigation confirmed that the laborers were indeed working under inhumane conditions, with no access to clean water or proper shelter. The court ruled that the state government had to take immediate action to protect these workers' rights.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key orders</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>Establish Vigilance Committees: The Haryana government was ordered to set up committees to monitor and ensure compliance with labor laws.</li>
<li>Identify Bonded Laborers: District magistrates were tasked with identifying bonded laborers.</p>
<li>Rehabilitation: The government had to provide housing and support for the affected workers.</li>
<li>Implement Minimum Wages: Both state and central governments were directed to enforce minimum wage laws for these workers.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Significance</strong></b></p>
<p>This case was crucial because it expanded the concept of public interest litigation (PIL) in India, allowing NGOs and individuals to represent the rights of marginalized groups. It highlighted the importance of protecting human rights and ensuring justice for vulnerable populations, making it easier for such cases to be heard in court.</p>

<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Why Restriction ?</strong></b></p>
To ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.
<p><b><strong style="color:#191970;">Prithi Pal Singh Bedi vs Union of India (1982)</strong></b></p>
<p>In the Prithi Pal Singh Bedi vs Union of India (1982) case, the Supreme Court upheld the power of Parliament to restrict fundamental rights for armed forces personnel under Article 33 of the Indian Constitution. The court emphasized that maintaining discipline and order within the military is crucial for effective functioning. It ruled that laws made under Article 33 cannot be challenged in courts, reinforcing that the government needs to ensure security and discipline among its forces, even if it means limiting certain rights like freedom of speech and assembly. This case highlighted the balance between individual rights and military discipline.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:191970;">Babita Puniya case</strong></b></p>
<p>The Babita Puniya case is a landmark legal decision in India that significantly advanced women's rights in the military.</p> 
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Background</strong></b></p>
<p>In February 2003, Babita Puniya, a practicing lawyer, filed a petition in the Delhi High Court. She sought to grant permanent commissions (PC) to women officers in the Indian Army, arguing that they should have the same opportunities as their male counterparts.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Key Developments</strong></b></p>
<p><ul><li>2003-2010: Several women officers joined Babita's cause, filing petitions for equal rights. The Delhi High Court ruled in favor of granting permanent commissions to women officers, but the government did not implement this decision.</li>
<li>2011: The case reached the Supreme Court after the government challenged the High Court’s ruling. The Supreme Court upheld the earlier decision, emphasizing that denying women permanent commissions was discriminatory.</li>
<li>2019: The government announced guidelines for granting permanent commissions but limited them to new recruits, excluding those already serving.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Supreme court Judgment</strong></b></p>
<br>On February 17, 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment:</br>
<p>The court ruled that women officers must be granted permanent commissions and should be eligible for command positions.</p>
<p>Justice D.Y. Chandrachud stated that restrictions based on gender stereotypes were unconstitutional and violated women's fundamental rights under Article 14 (right to equality).</p>
<p>The court acknowledged that women had been serving effectively in the army and deserved equal opportunities without discrimination.</p>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Impact</strong></b></p>
<P>This ruling was a significant step towards gender equality in the Indian military:</p>
<ul><li>It allowed women to hold higher ranks and receive benefits like promotions and pensions.</li>
<li>The judgment challenged outdated perceptions of women's roles in the military and recognized their capabilities.</li></ul>
<p><b><strong style="color:red;">Conclusion</strong></b></p>
<p>The Babita Puniya case marked a pivotal moment for women's rights in India, ensuring that female officers could serve on equal footing with male officers in all aspects of military service. It set a precedent for further advancements in gender equality within the armed forces and beyond.</p>
